# Hello There!

There's nearly 1.1 billion websites on the internet and funny enough, you've stumbled acrossed this one today.

I made this website to primarily serve as my personal yapping zone. Mostly gonna blog about technical stuffs which I'll try my best to explain in layman terms. Check out the <a href="/posts">posts</a> section.

Anyways before you get bored, I'm <b>Siddhartha</b> <span class="pronc">(/ðŸ”Š:"s-ih-d-dh-aa-r-th-oh"/)</span>, btw. I <strike>like to</strike> write code until it gets painful. My current interests are inclined towards applied cryptography, notably on [Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) ; and exploring the core system of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org).

Oh, and I also rock out in a [band](https://www.instagram.com/acids.n.basses/) and dabble in a bit of art. Also up for a lightsaber duel. Seriously.

Feel free to reach out to me. I'm up for a conversation about almost anything. I'll be linking my socials below.

That being said, as Truman Bubank says: <q>In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!</q>
